## Purpose

This project is intended for practice and learning.  
It helps beginners understand how backend logic interacts with databases and how technologies like Mongoose simplify working with MongoDB. The addition of MySQL provides a way to compare relational and non-relational approaches. The structure is kept simple so learners can easily explore both systems and strengthen their backend fundamentals.
